# Spartan-6 DSP48A1 Design and Testbench
This repository contains the design and testbench for the DSP48A1 slice of the Spartan-6 FPGA family. The Spartan-6 family is known for its high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for math-intensive applications.

## Project Overview
This project involves designing the DSP48A1 slice, creating a testbench for verification, and running the design flow using Vivado and QuestaSim. The design includes various pipeline registers and control inputs to handle complex arithmetic operations efficiently.
